# forecasting_notebooks
Application of forecasting modeling techniques to various use-cases in industry and science. We explore univariate models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA), multivariate models (SARIMAX, VAR, VARMAX), as well as machine learning models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Neural Networks).

Use cases explored include popular datasets int he literature of these models, as well as the ones found in the sources. While we follow the general gist of specific chapters, we enrich case under consideration by incorporating modern techniques from other sources, as well as from personal professional experience.  

Sources include "Advanced Forecasting with Python" by Korstanje, "Data Science for Supply Chain Forecasting" by Vanderput, and "Regression Analysis" by Jim Frost.
