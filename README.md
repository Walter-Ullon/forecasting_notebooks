# ðŸ“ˆ forecasting_notebooks
Application of forecasting modeling techniques to various use-cases in industry and science. We explore univariate models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA), multivariate models (SARIMAX, VAR, VARMAX), as well as machine learning models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Neural Networks).

Use cases explored include popular datasets in the literature of these models, as well as the ones found in the sources. While we follow the general gist of specific chapters, we enrich each case under consideration by incorporating modern techniques from other sources as well as from personal professional and academic experience.
